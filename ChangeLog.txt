0.0.4
Registration Validation
  Added: minimizing sum(bitwise_and(registered, template)) as criterion for optimal registration
  Added: quota for the number of improvements to the registration before grading takes place
  Added: function getAnswerMap returns structure of answer coords according to the specification in google docs

0.0.3
Perspective Transform and Canny Refinement
  Added: Main - View variable for debugging purposes, shows a set of images based on its value
  Added: Main - Suppresion variable to suppress errors being printed to console
  Added: Preprocessing - Morphological tranformations to the canny output
  Added: FindPoints - now outputs 4 points, as needed for the perspective transform
  Fixed: Transform - transformation is now a 3D perspective transform, fourth point of template hard coded in source
  Added: Grade - kmeans on convolution results to find threshold, currently crudely taking average between high and low
  Added: Grade - deprecated code based on ideal template (425, 550) metrics


0.0.2
Modularization
  Added: Corner validation now mostly works (methods added to FindPoints.py: findCorners(), partitionPoints())
  Added: Code refactor, compartmentalized algorithm into separate modules.
          The Main file is the main loop that calls the following
          Preprocess.py accepts the image, the new shape, and the big and small square regions.
            It returns the edges image with only the region drawn and the original image with the square
            regions drawn and resized.
          FindPoints.py accepts the edges image and the image.
            It returns the list of intersections and the image with the intersections drawn on.
          Transform.py accepts the image and the intersection points used to transform.
            It returns the registered image and the blend of the image with the template.
          Grade.py accepts the registered.
            It does not return but will list out the answers.
  Added: Error.py to contain the user defined errors that are now being raised

0.0.1
CornerValidate:
  FIXED: houghlines had an improper parameter set
  Added: validateCorners() (incomplete)
  Added: offset() method to determine the offset values based on the window size
  Added: global variables pi and win as the number pi and the window size
  Added: drawSquare() to draw a square on the image, used to help user align the sheet
  Added: region() to black out all except the expected area for the answer sheet to be located
  Added: Check to make sure at least 4 lines are detected
  Added: filter the result of kmeans() on the detected lines so only lines with certain angles show (may not work)
  added: Check to make sure at least 4 intersections are found
  Added: run kmeans() on the intersection points to obtain only 4 points
